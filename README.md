JPong
================================

JPong is a very simple clone of Pong (1972), one of the earliest video games ever published.
This clone has been realized entirely with the Java programming language, using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) Java built-in library for the rendering of all the entities (ball, paddles, score, and other messages) onto the screen.

The features of JPong are:
- Stable gameplay at 30 FPS;
- Possibility for the user to play with either the keyboard (ARROW UP for moving the paddle up, and ARROW DOWN for moving the paddle down) or the mouse;
- Simple AI for the CPU-controlled paddle;
- Anti-aliasing on all the entities drawn onto the screen.

JPong has been realized by Stefano "CianciuStyles" Cianciulli.
